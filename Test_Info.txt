NOTE: Eval value should be the same, the game/practices time slots may varied 
based off how I got the result vs how the program gets the result. So the eval 
value should be the same for the answer I got and what the program got. If the 
eval value is different please let me know and save the answer the program got 
and send it to me and I'll compare the two answers.
