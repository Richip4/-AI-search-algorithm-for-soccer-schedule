NOTE: Eval value should be the same, the game/practices time slots may varied based 
off how I got the result vs how the program gets the result. So the eval value should 
be the same for the answer I got and what the program got. If the eval value is 
different please let me know and save the answer the program got and send it to me 
and I'll compare the two answers.
